# Ventzislav Ivanov — Project Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my most significant academic and personal coding projects.  
I work at the intersection of machine learning, data science, and software development, 
with interests ranging from econometrics to natural language processing and simulation modeling.

## 🧠 Highlights

### 1. [Bachelor Thesis — SO-LLF Machine Learning Model](Bachelor-Thesis_SO-LLF/)
- Replication and extension of Friedberg et al. (2021) Local Linear Forests.
- Implemented Second-Order Local Linear Forests (SO-LLFs) for curvature modeling.
- Built in R, benchmarked against RF, XGBoost, BART, and LLF.

### 2. [Cryptocurrency Sentiment Predictor](Cryptocurrency-Sentiment/)
- LSTM models combining financial and Reddit sentiment data.
- Global grid search over sentiment coefficients (α, β, γ, θ).
- Tools: Python, Keras, Pandas, Matplotlib.

### 3. [Eminem Sentiment & Lyric Analysis](Eminem-Sentiment-Analysis/)
- Scraped and cleaned lyrics from Genius API.
- Performed sentiment analysis, rhyme density, and word frequency statistics.
- Visualized linguistic evolution across albums.

### 4. [Neural Network Stock Price Volatility Prediction](Neural-Network-Volatility/)
- Built and tuned feedforward neural networks for financial volatility forecasting.
- Compared to ARIMA and GARCH baselines.

### 5. [5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Java)](5x5-TicTacToe-Java/)
- Custom rule engine with power-ups (tile swapper, reserver, etc.).
- Implemented with custom GUI and comparator-based sorting logic.

### 6. [Time Series Simulation](Time-Series-Simulation/)
- Simulated autoregressive and chaotic time series models for comparison studies.

### 7. [Virus Spread Simulation (Java)](Virus-Spread-Simulation-Java/)
- Agent-based modeling of infection spread under variable contact rates.

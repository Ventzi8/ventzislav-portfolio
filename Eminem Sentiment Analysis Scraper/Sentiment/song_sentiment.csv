You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuckin' beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard 
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? 

[Verse]
Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son, listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun and have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
Wit' your corny lines —ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill, now I'ma make a mountain out of you 
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead 
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still 
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
""Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddie, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay, so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist 
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this 
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! 
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection, go to sleep six feet deep
I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven, you'd look up to me
And for the record, you would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This motherfuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady, he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty 'cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really, I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells, attempt fails! Budden, L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it 
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it 
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers 
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it


[Outro]
You fuckin'—, oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you",0.191,0.709,0.1,-0.9989

Alright, here we go

First, I'ma shred a— 
Verse like I had a personal vendetta 
Words come together like birds of a feather 
'Til I need a walker like Herschel, I'm better 
Than all of you fuckin' little twerps put together
But I'm not tryna be controversial, I'd rather 
Talk about shit with a purpose that matters 
Like, who had the second best verse on ""Forever""? 
Now, I got a riddle 
One condition, you mustn't laugh 
What is the opposite of Benzino? 
A giraffe 
""Go at his neck,"" how the fuck is that? 
How can I go at something he doesn't have? 
Arm so short he can't even touch his hands
When they're above his head doing jumping jacks 
Sorry, I don't mean  to upset you, Ben' 
When I talk about  all the debt you in 
I hear that you been  creepin' on the low
In them cheap hotels  that they catch you in 
Jesus Christ, dawg , when you said two-ten 
Never guessed you meant  at the Red Roof Inn 
In a room with one  single bed, two men 
Shady, man, you can't, yes, you can 
Well, I guess then I regret to inform you, hate to spoil a day 
But this doesn't bring me no joy to say 
Guess that Coi Leray feat's in the toilet, eh? 
Yeah
Damage due to flows, collateral, I s'pose
Gat pointed like mine and Sandra Bullock's nose 
Yeah, them bullet holes , have you full of those 
You'll catch a stray like Animal Control , plan a funeral
I'ma probably have to plan a few neurological exams
Once again, it is off into that damn padded room I go
Right toward the asylum or the psych ward
Because I strangled you with a mic cord
Because my , fuckin' mind's morbid
I'm on my  Pegasus, my high horse, and I'm fly 
Bitch, I soar like a sty
You probably feel like you're gonna die 
'Cause you're in my morgue and you're tied up like a tight score
And that's why  I'm back with Cole Bennett

Far enough to put something material over a human life?
What would drive someone completely over the edge
To do some shit like that for green and gold?

My neck's bloated, my TEC's loaded
I'm flat broke and I'm pissed off
Mad at the world, I've had it with girls, and I'm frustrated
Ran to the bus stop, just made it and hopped on
Ready to drop bombs on the first person

I spot John white collar worker in clean cut
Walked up to him, he's like, ""What?""
What you mean, ""What?""
You know what time it is, man
At your next stop, gimme that Rolex watch
With that diamond wristband
Got his green and his gold dashed and climbed in his van
To steal it and seen a man holding a nine in his hand
Shot him from the bottom up
Stole his keys, put 'em inside the ignition and got 'em stuck
Hopped out to flee on my feet
Fucked around and forgot that I left my ID on the seat",0.155,0.766,0.079,-0.9569

Straight, only way to be great is to dig down, if you could hear the sound in-
Side my head sounds like a fuckin' drive-by, that's what the inside of my mind's like
Lookin' back on my career, even hindsights, tunnel vision, 5 mics
Never wanted that so bad, felt like I could go mad, nomad with a notepad
Go Taz, spaz on these ho bags, it bothered me, but I never wanna show that
Just don't act like it ever does even though you know that there will never come
A day someone blows past you, never was someone who's as dope as you ever was, and you hope that's
True 'cause the competitor in you couldn't let somebody be better than you, and you know that
So you don't ever hold back, what? You're gonna go back to workin' a regular job?
Fuck that, I'ma go hard, grab on my gonads, tell 'em fuck theyself
They call me a wigger like Renee Zell', but I raised hell like a stay-at-home dad
Rap is the only thing that I was ever really bad to the bone at
Guess I'm similar to gangrene, when I'm angry, then I'm Hulk Smash
So much passion but no compassion, if eyes are the windows to the soul
Then it's broken glass, and there's no trespassin', a'ight, now here we go
Dre stamped me, now I'm stampin' Yelawolf, get ready for the most competitive
Clique in the world, it's like Clash of the Titans, I released the cracker, it's time to set it again
And when it's said and it's all done, none shall ever fuck with this squadron

May I have your attention, please? Will the real Slim Shady please stand up? I repeat Will the real Slim Shady please stand up? We're gonna have a problem here [Verse 1] Y'all act like you never seen a white person before Jaws all on the floor like Pam; like Tommy just burst in the door And started whoopin' her ass worse than before They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"" And Dr. Dre said Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement Feminist women love Eminem ""Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though"" Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose ""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"" And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss And that's the message that we deliver to little kids And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is By the time they hit fourth grade they've got the Discovery Channel, don't they? We ain't nothin' but mammals Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes [Chorus] I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?

Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me ""But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?"" Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here? So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears? Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first Little bitch put me on blast on MTV ""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee"" I should download her audio on MP3 And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me So I have been sent here to destroy you And there's a million of us just like me Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me [Chorus] 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? [Verse 3] I'm like a head trip to listen to 'Cause I'm only givin' you things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all I just get on the mic and spit it And whether you like to admit it , I just shit it Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can Then you wonder, ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"" It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin' He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!"" With his windows down and his system up So will the real Shady please stand up And put one of those fingers on each hand up? And be proud to be out of your mind and out of control And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
